    "The key takeaways from this section include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you import time series data into Pandas, make sure to use the time/date information as index values using either a Pandas `timestamp` or Python `datetime` data type\n",
    "- There are a range of built-in methods in Pandas for easily downsampling or upsampling time series data\n",
    "- Line plots and dot plots can be useful for getting a sense of how a time series dataset changes over time\n",
    "- Histograms and density plots can be useful for getting a sense of the time-independent distribution of a time series \n",
    "- Box and whisker plots per year (or other seasonality period - day, week, month, etc) can be a great way to easily see trends in the distribution of time series data over time\n",
    "- Heat maps can also be useful for comparing changes of time series data across a couple of dimensions. For example, with months on one axis and years on another, they can be a great way to see both seasonality and year on year trends\n",
    "- A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties such as mean and variance remain constant over time\n",
    "- Most time series models work on the assumption that the time series are stationary (assumption of homoscedasticity)\n",
    "- Many time series datasets *do* have trends, violating the assumption of homoscedasticity\n",
    "- Common examples are trends that include linear (straight line over time), exponential, and periodic. Some datasets also have increasing (or decreasing) variance over time\n",
    "- Any given dataset may exhibit multiple trends (e.g. linear, periodic, and reduction of variance)\n",
    "- Rolling statistics can be used to test for trends to see whether the centrality and/or dispersion of time series changes over time\n",
    "- The Dickey-Fuller test is a common test for determining whether a time series contains trends\n",
    "- Common approaches for removing trends and seasonality include taking a log-transform, subtracting the rolling mean, and differencing\n",
    "- Decomposing allows you to separately view *seasonality* (which could be daily, weekly, annual, etc), *trend*, and *random*, which is the variability in time series after removing the effects of the seasonality and trend \n"
